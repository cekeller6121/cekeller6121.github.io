      <div class="about">
        <p>After spending nearly ten years in public saftey, I made a career change to software development. I've spent thousands of hours learning on the job and in the classroom to become a dependable, focused employee and team member with strong attention to detail. I'm always learning new things and I'm currently working on mobile and responsive web design. Currently, all of my projects are either mobile friendly or mobile first.
